# Roadmap — juberahmed.dev

Build plan for the portfolio site. Structured as **checkpoints**, each sized to fit
one Claude Code session. Read this + [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (the brief) +
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) (the concrete design system) before starting a checkpoint.

The finished visual design already exists — see
[`design-reference/home-mockup.html`](design-reference/home-mockup.html) (open it in a
browser to see both themes). Our job is to rebuild it as a real Next.js app and ship it.

---

## Locked decisions (from planning session, 2026-07-11)

- **Greenfield.** Fresh `create-next-app` in this folder. Claude inits git + first
  commit. **Owner creates the empty GitHub repo** (`Juber-Ahmed98/…`) — Claude then
  wires the remote and pushes.
- **CV PDF:** owner will provide the file. Until then the "Download CV" button points
  to a clearly-marked placeholder (`/cv.pdf`, not yet added) — do not fake it.
- **Screenshots:** MVP ships with the styled **placeholder tiles** from the mockup.
  Real screenshots of the three live demos get swapped in during Milestone 3.
- **Deploy:** build & polish the whole home page locally first, then a **single
  Cloudflare Pages setup** at the end of Milestone 1 (CP4).

## Tech (from CLAUDE.md)

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- **Static export** (`output: 'export'`) → Cloudflare Pages. No SSR, no server
  actions. Client components for interactivity; build-time data only.
- Images: `next/image` with `unoptimized: true`, or plain `<img>`.
- Deploy target: root domain `juberahmed.dev` on the existing Cloudflare account.

## How to run a checkpoint

1. Pick the next unchecked checkpoint below. Do **only** that checkpoint.
2. Match the mockup — pull exact tokens/specs from [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).
3. Hit the **Done when** bar. Verify `npm run build` (static export) still succeeds.
4. Commit with a clear message. Tick the box here and jot anything the next session
   needs under **Notes**.

## Milestone 1 — MVP home page, live and shareable

### ☑ CP0 · Scaffold & foundation  ✅ done 2026-07-11
Goal: a themed, empty app that static-exports cleanly.
- `create-next-app` — TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router, `src/` dir, no ESLint prompt drama.
- `next.config`: `output: 'export'`, `images.unoptimized: true`, `trailingSlash: true`.
- Fonts via `next/font/google`: **Plus Jakarta Sans** (400–800) + **JetBrains Mono**
  (400–600). Expose as CSS variables.
- Global CSS: drop in the **full light + dark token set** from DESIGN.md as CSS
  variables on `:root` / `.dark`.
- Theme system: use **`next-themes`** (class strategy, `defaultTheme="system"`,
  no default opinion) so system preference is respected and there's **no flash** on
  load. Build the toggle button (☾ / ☀) but it can live in a placeholder header for now.
- `git init`, `.gitignore`, first commit.

Done when: `npm run dev` shows a page that switches light/dark with no flash, and
`npm run build` produces a static `out/` with no errors.

**Notes for next session (CP1):**
- Stack landed: **Next 16.2.10, React 19.2.4, Tailwind v4** (no `tailwind.config`
  — theme lives in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme`/`@custom-variant`).
- Tokens are Tailwind utilities now: `bg-bg`, `text-ink`, `text-body`, `text-muted`,
  `bg-accent`, `border-line`, `bg-chip`, `text-wip`, `bg-flag`, etc. Fonts:
  `font-sans` (Plus Jakarta) / `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono). Prefer these over
  raw `var(--x)` where a utility exists.
- Theme: `next-themes`, class strategy, `.dark` on `<html>`, `defaultTheme="system"`.
  Toggle at `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`; provider at `theme-provider.tsx`.
- `next.config.ts` pins `turbopack.root` (a stray `package-lock.json` sits in the
  parent `GitHub/` dir — leave it, the pin handles it).
- Branch is `main`; first commit `6e47d13`. `src/app/page.tsx` is a throwaway CP0
  placeholder — replace it in CP1. Left-over scaffold SVGs in `public/` can be
  deleted whenever.

### ☑ CP1 · Nav + Hero + content data model  ✅ done 2026-07-11
Goal: top of the page pixel-matches the mockup, and content is data-driven.
- Create a typed content module (e.g. `src/content/site.ts`) holding: nav links,
  hero copy + stats, the 6 **wall** projects, the 3 **featured** projects, experience
  entries, toolbox chips, contact links. Source the data from the mockup's script
  block and CLAUDE.md.
- **Nav** component: logo `juberahmed.dev` (accent on `.dev`), links, theme toggle,
  Download CV button. Sticky-or-static per DESIGN.md.
- **Hero** component: eyebrow line, H1 with the highlight underline on "front to
  back.", sub-paragraph, mono stat row (gated on `showHeroStats`).

Done when: nav + hero match the mockup in both themes, content comes from the data
module, build passes.

**Notes for next session (CP2):**
- **Content module `src/content/site.ts` already holds EVERYTHING** — not just nav +
  hero. Exports: `nav`, `hero`, `flagship` (the dark Jembatan card, kept separate
  from the rows), `featured` (the 2 rows), `wall` (6), `currentlyBuilding` (the
  dashed strip), `experience`, `toolbox`, `contact`. CP2/CP3 should render from
  these, not re-type data. Types are exported alongside each.
- Section components live in `src/components/` (`nav.tsx`, `hero.tsx`). `page.tsx`
  composes them: `<Nav/>` then `<main>` wrapping sections. Add Featured/Wall inside
  `<main>`.
- **Nav decision: sticky** (`sticky top-0 z-50`) with `bg-bg/80 backdrop-blur-md`
  — better for one-page anchor nav. Nav links `hidden … sm:inline` (a stopgap; the
  real mobile-nav collapse is CP3).
- Hero takes `showStats?: boolean` (default true) — the `showHeroStats` gate.
- CV buttons point to `/cv.pdf` (placeholder, file not added yet — per locked
  decision). Contact LinkedIn is still `#` (needs URL, CP3).
- Deleted the leftover CP0 scaffold SVGs in `public/`.
- **Local preview:** `.claude/launch.json` runs `npm run dev` with `autoPort:true`
  (port 3000 is taken by an unrelated "Arabic Academy" app on this machine).
- Verified: build static-exports clean; theme toggle flips `.dark` on `<html>` and
  all tokens resolve in both themes; no console errors. (Note: the in-app browser's
  compositor hangs on screenshots here — verified via a11y tree + computed styles
  instead, which is reliable.)

### ☑ CP2 · Featured work + The Wall  ✅ done 2026-07-11
Goal: the two core "proof" sections.
- **Featured work**: the dark **Jembatan flagship** card (2-col, "live in production"
  badge, live/case-study/code buttons) + the two featured rows (Mission to Abs,
  E-commerce). Screenshot areas use the **placeholder tiles** for now.
  Case-study links point to `#` (wired in Milestone 2).
- **The Wall**: 3-col grid of all 6 builds, data-driven from the content module, with
  live/building badges and tags. The dashed **"currently building → habit_tracker"**
  strip sits directly beneath (this is how the mockup folds the "currently building"
  content in — no separate section needed).

Done when: both sections match the mockup in both themes, wall renders from data, build passes.

**Notes for next session (CP3):**
- **Section-header data** now lives in `src/content/site.ts` as `sections` — currently
  only `featured` ({index,title}) and `wall` ({index,title,sub}). CP3 should add
  `experience` (index `03`) + `contact` (index `04`) entries there and render via the
  shared `<SectionHeading>` (`src/components/section-heading.tsx`: mono index + H2,
  takes `className` for spacing).
- Sections built: `src/components/featured.tsx` (flagship card + 2 rows) and
  `wall.tsx` (6-card hairline grid + dashed WIP strip). `page.tsx` composes
  `Nav → Hero → Featured → Wall`. Add Experience + Contact after Wall.
- **Flagship + contact cards are dark in BOTH themes** — their *internal* colours are
  the fixed dark hex from the mockup (`#22c8e0`/`#f2f7f8`/`#b8c8cd`/`#7e959c`/`#2c4148`),
  NOT tokens. The card shell uses `bg-flag`/`border-flag-line` (already dark in both
  themes). Reuse this exact pattern for the contact CTA card in CP3.
- **Everything is still desktop-only** (fixed `grid-cols-[…px]`): flagship
  `grid-cols-[1.05fr_460px]`, featured rows `grid-cols-[60px_1.1fr_420px]`, wall
  `grid-cols-3`. CP3's responsive pass must add breakpoints so all of these stack
  (flagship 2→1, rows 3→stacked, wall 3→2→1) — budget for it as first-class work.
- `flagship.links` is `as const`, so its "Case study" entry has no `external` key —
  narrow with `"external" in link && link.external` (not `link.external`) if you touch it.
- Verified CP2: `npm run build` static-exports clean (TS strict passes); both sections
  render from the data module; both themes resolve. **Gotcha:** the in-app browser's
  `getComputedStyle` reports *mid-transition* values because of body's `transition:
  background .3s` — reads flip-flop unless you inject `*{transition:none!important}`
  first. Do that before trusting computed colours here.

### ☑ CP3 · Experience + Contact + responsive & a11y pass  ✅ done 2026-07-11
Goal: finish the page and make it real on mobile + accessible.
- **Experience**: two-column (roles timeline + toolbox chips).
- **Contact**: dark CTA card ("Hire someone who ships."), Download CV (placeholder),
  Email (mailto), GitHub, **LinkedIn** (needs URL — see Open questions). Footer line.
- **Responsive**: the mockup is desktop-only (fixed px grid columns). Add breakpoints
  so every multi-column grid stacks cleanly on tablet/mobile (nav collapses, flagship
  card goes single-column, wall 3→2→1, experience 2→1). This is real work — budget for it.
- **A11y**: semantic landmarks, real heading order, focus-visible states, `aria-label`
  on the toggle, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, color-contrast check in both themes.

Done when: full home page complete, looks right from 375px → wide desktop, keyboard-
navigable, build passes.

**Notes for next session (CP4):**
- Page is now complete: `page.tsx` composes `Nav → Hero → Featured → Wall →
  Experience → Contact`. New components: `experience.tsx`, `contact.tsx`,
  `mobile-menu.tsx` (client). `sections` in `site.ts` gained `experience` (03) +
  `contact` (04, index only — its H2 lives in `contact.heading`).
- **Contact card** reuses the flagship pattern exactly: `bg-flag`/`border-flag-line`
  shell (dark in both themes) + fixed dark hex internals (`#22c8e0`/`#f2f7f8`/
  `#2c4148`), NOT tokens. Footer is a real `<footer>` (contentinfo) under the card.
- **Responsive breakpoints** (verified at 375 / 768 / desktop, no horizontal overflow):
  flagship + featured rows `grid-cols-1 → md:` fixed-px; wall `1 → sm:2 → lg:3`;
  experience `1 → md:2` (the `ml-[74px]` indent drops to `ml-0` below `sm`). All
  section horizontal padding is now `px-6 sm:px-10`. Hero padding also eased on mobile.
- **Mobile nav:** below `sm` the anchor links collapse into `MobileMenu` (a client
  `useState` hamburger dropdown, `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`, closes on tap).
  Inline links are `hidden sm:inline`; the nav "Download CV" button is
  `hidden min-[400px]:inline-block` (too tight alongside the hamburger at 375).
- **A11y:** landmarks confirmed via a11y tree (banner / nav "Primary" / main /
  region "Experience" / region "Contact" / contentinfo). Sections carry `aria-label`.
  Toolbox is a real `<ul>`/`<li>`. Global `:focus-visible` ring (accent, both themes)
  added in `globals.css`; `prefers-reduced-motion` now also neutralises the hover-lift
  transforms (not just scroll/theme transitions).
- **⚠️ LinkedIn URL still `#`** (contact card + `site.ts`). Owner hasn't provided it —
  left as an honest placeholder per the locked "don't fake it" rule. Wire it in when
  supplied (also the featured "Live demo" links for Mission to Abs / E-commerce are
  still `#`).
- Screenshots still hang the in-app browser's compositor (as in CP2) — verified via
  a11y tree + computed styles + `getComputedStyle` (inject `*{transition:none}` first).

### ☑ CP4 · Deploy to Cloudflare Pages  ✅ done 2026-07-11
Goal: live at juberahmed.dev.
- Owner creates the GitHub repo; Claude wires remote + pushes.
- Create a Cloudflare Pages project from the repo (build: `next build`, output: `out`).
- Attach custom domain `juberahmed.dev` (root). Verify HTTPS + both themes live.

Done when: the polished home page is live at https://juberahmed.dev and shareable.
**← End of Milestone 1: the site is real.**

**CP4 progress / notes:**
- **LinkedIn URL resolved** — `https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-juber-ahmed/`
  now wired into `contact.links` in `site.ts` (the last CP3 open question). Contact
  card renders it live (target=_blank, rel=noreferrer). Verified in preview.
- **Repo pushed.** Local `main` was 3 commits ahead (CP1–CP3 unpushed); all pushed to
  `github.com/Juber-Ahmed98/portfolio_website` along with the LinkedIn fix + Node pin.
- **Deploy method chosen: Git integration** (owner's call, matches locked decision) —
  auto-deploys on every push. NOT direct-upload wrangler.
- **Node pinned** via `.node-version` (`22`) so CF Pages builds on a known-good Node
  (local is 24; Next 16 needs ≥20.9). `out/` is gitignored — CF builds it server-side.
- **Verified locally:** `npm run build` static-exports clean; `out/` has `index.html`,
  `404.html`, `_next/`. This is exactly what Pages serves.
- **⏳ Owner must do (dashboard — CLI can't authorize the GitHub OAuth connection):**
  1. CF dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** → pick
     `Juber-Ahmed98/portfolio_website`, branch `main`.
  2. Build settings — Framework preset: **Next.js (Static HTML Export)** (or None);
     **Build command:** `npx next build`; **Build output directory:** `out`. Save & Deploy.
  3. After first build goes green: project → **Custom domains → Set up a domain** →
     `juberahmed.dev` (root). CF auto-adds the DNS record since the domain is on-account.
  4. Verify HTTPS + light/dark both live at https://juberahmed.dev, then tick this box.
- **✅ Verified live 2026-07-11:** https://juberahmed.dev serves the full page (all
  content present, HTTPS working). Milestone 1 is complete.

## Milestone 2 — Case-study pages (Jembatan first)

### ☑ CP5 · Case-study template + routing  ✅ done 2026-07-12
- `/work/[slug]` static route with `generateStaticParams` (Jembatan, Mission to Abs,
  E-commerce). Shared layout: problem → approach → stack → screenshots → live + code
  links, plus back-to-home nav. Case-study content lives in the content module.
- Wire the "Case study →" links from the featured section to these routes.

Done when: three case-study routes build statically and link both ways with the home page.

**Notes for next session (CP6):**
- **Content model:** `src/content/site.ts` now has `caseStudies: Record<slug, CaseStudy>`
  + `caseStudyOrder` (drives `generateStaticParams`). Each `CaseStudy` = eyebrow, name,
  tagline, intro, `stack` (mono line), `stackChips[]`, `blocks[]` ({heading, body[]}),
  `screenshots[]` (placeholder labels), `links[]`. CP6 deepens **Jembatan**'s `blocks`
  (currently 3 starter blocks: problem / approach / what I learned) — just add/extend
  blocks in the data; the template renders any number in order.
- **Route:** `src/app/work/[slug]/page.tsx` — server component, `dynamicParams = false`,
  `generateStaticParams` + `generateMetadata` (per-page `<title>`). Awaits
  `params` (Next 16 Promise). Slim own header (← Home / brand / ThemeToggle / CV),
  NOT the home `<Nav>` (its `#anchor` links don't work cross-page).
- **Honesty rule kept:** links with `href: "#"` (Mission to Abs / E-commerce live demos
  — still not public) are **filtered out**, so those pages show only a real Code button.
  When those demos go live, set the real URL in `caseStudies[...].links` (and the home
  `featured[...]` live link, still `#`).
- **Linking:** `featured.tsx` gained a `ProjectLink` helper — internal `/work/…` hrefs
  render as `next/link` (client nav, no theme flash); external stay `<a target=_blank>`.
  Flagship + both rows wired. `flagship`/`featured` entries gained a `slug` field.
- **Template is fully token-driven** → both themes verified (dark body `#0b1418`/`#f2f7f8`,
  CV btn inverts, chips `#2c4148`). No fixed-hex except none — unlike the flagship/contact
  cards, case-study pages use normal `bg-bg`/`text-ink` tokens (light-or-dark per theme).
- **Screenshots** are still the diagonal-stripe placeholder tiles (real captures = CP8).
- Verified: `npm run build` static-exports `/work/jembatan`, `/work/mission-to-abs`,
  `/work/ecommerce-store` (all `● SSG`); no console errors; home "Case study →" links
  navigate client-side and each page's "← Back to all work" returns to `/#work`.
  (Screenshot compositor still hangs in the in-app browser — verified via a11y tree +
  computed styles, as in CP2–CP4.)

### ☑ CP6 · Jembatan case study (the deep one)  ✅ done 2026-07-12
- Full narrative: the product (app + Cloudflare Worker `/api/v1/translate`),
  approach, UX research (onboarding/keyboard/latency), roadmap, branding. This is the
  flagship — it should carry the most depth.

**Notes for next session (CP7):**
- **⚠️ The brief + prior content were out of date.** The *real* current Jembatan lives in a
  **private** repo at `C:\Users\moham\Documents\Claude\Projects\Jembatan-app` (git remote
  `github.com/Juber-Ahmed98/Jembatan-app` — **private, so the public "Code ↗" link 404s**).
  The public `github.com/Juber-Ahmed98/Jembatan` repo is the **frozen legacy PWA** (its
  `CLAUDE.md` says "BUILD NOT STARTED"); do not source facts from it.
- **What Jembatan actually is (verified from the private repo):** a **native Kotlin Android
  keyboard (IME)** + Jetpack Compose settings, backed by a **live** Cloudflare Worker
  (`POST /api/v1/translate`, deployed 2026-06-19) using **OpenAI `gpt-5-mini`** (NOT Whisper —
  that was an earlier model; STT is **on-device**, server transcription `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`
  is Pro-only). Five languages (en/id/bn/ar/es), free daily cap + Pro billing via RevenueCat +
  Play Console (sandbox-confirmed). In real daily use + closed Play test; not yet public-launched.
- **Fixed the stale "Whisper" claim** in `flagship.blurb` (→ "gpt-5-mini … with on-device
  speech"). `flagship.stack` "kotlin · cloudflare-workers · openai-api" and the wall entry
  ("kotlin · workers", "live ↗") are **accurate** — left as-is.
- **CP6 rewrote `caseStudies.jembatan`** in `src/content/site.ts` — 9 deep blocks (problem →
  loop → backend → translation → latency → keyboard → trust → design/brand → status), new
  accurate intro + stackChips, and real screenshot labels. All claims are **shipped features
  only**; the repo's `RESEARCH-*.md` docs are forward-looking ("nothing here is built") so their
  proposals are framed as "current focus," not done.
- **Two open items to raise with the owner (see chat):** (1) the private-repo 404 on the Code
  button — make repo public before launch, or drop the button; (2) real screenshots for Jembatan
  already exist at `…/Jembatan-app/screenshots/` (01-home, probe-translated, probe-review,
  probe-kbd, 02-in-person) — ready to swap in at **CP8**.
- CP7 (Mission to Abs + E-commerce) is unaffected; those studies are still the CP5 starter drafts.

### ☐ CP7 · Mission to Abs + E-commerce case studies
- Two shorter studies. Mission to Abs → frontend craft (motion, charts, state).
  E-commerce → ties to the Wolseley day-job.

---

## Milestone 3 — Polish, real assets, launch-ready

### ☐ CP8 · Real screenshots + CV PDF
- Capture real screenshots from the three live demos (the `screenshots` skill can
  help), optimize, swap into the featured cards + case studies.
- Drop in the real CV PDF, wire the Download CV buttons to it.

### ☐ CP9 · Motion pass
- Add `framer-motion` **sparingly** (per the brief): hero entrance, purposeful card
  hovers, subtle scroll-reveal on sections. All gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### ☐ CP10 · SEO / meta / final a11y + launch
- Per-page metadata, OpenGraph + Twitter card, an OG image, favicon, `sitemap.xml`,
  `robots.txt`. Lighthouse pass (perf/SEO/a11y). Final accessibility audit.

Done when: strong Lighthouse scores, share previews look right, ready to send to recruiters.

---

## Open questions to resolve before they're needed

- ~~**LinkedIn URL**~~ — ✅ resolved: `linkedin.com/in/mohammed-juber-ahmed/` (wired CP4).
- **CV PDF** — needed at CP8 (or earlier if ready).
- **Real screenshots** — captured at CP8 from the three live demos.
